- **ReactJS** is a _declarative_, _efficient_, and _flexible_ **JavaScript** library for building user interfaces.
- It is an _open-source_, _component-based_ **front-end** library that is responsible only for the view layer of the application.
- **ReactJS** is not a **_framework_**, it is just a **_library_** developed by **Facebook** to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.
- It is a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture-based library that plays the role of **“V”** which means _**view**_.
- It designs simple views for each state in our application, and **React** will efficiently **_update_** and **_render_** just the right _component_ when our data changes.
- The declarative view makes our code more predictable and easier to debug.
