# React-JS-Mastery
- **ReactJS** is a _declarative_, _efficient_, and _flexible_ **JavaScript** library for building user interfaces.
- It is an _open-source_, _component-based_ **front-end** library that is responsible only for the view layer of the application.
- **ReactJS** is not a **_framework_**, it is just a **_library_** developed by **Facebook** to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.
