# React-JS-Mastery
ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is an open-source, component-based front-end library that is responsible only for the view layer of the application. ReactJS is not a framework, it is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.
