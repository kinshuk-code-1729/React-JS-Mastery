- **ReactJS** is a _declarative_, _efficient_, and _flexible_ **JavaScript** library for building user interfaces.
- It is an _open-source_, _component-based_ **front-end** library that is responsible only for the view layer of the application.
- **ReactJS** is not a **_framework_**, it is just a **_library_** developed by **Facebook** to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.
- It is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture-based library that plays the role of “V” which means view. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.
